              <div class="q">🔐<span style="color:red"> Security Command Center (SCC)</span> </div>
              <div class="a">
                <div class="q"><strong>What is it?</strong></div>
                <div class="a">
                  Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC) is a security management platform that provides visibility, threat detection, vulnerability management, and compliance monitoring for Google Cloud resources. It helps detect threats, identify vulnerabilities, and automate responses, enhancing cloud security.
                </div>
                <div class="q"><strong>How to detect and respond to threats with SCC</strong></div>
<div class="a">
  <p>SCC detects threats and vulnerabilities. It includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Event Threat Detection</strong>: Detects known patterns (e.g., brute force, malware downloads).</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud Anomaly Detection</strong>: Uses machine learning to find unusual behaviors (e.g., leaked credentials, spikes in traffic).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Other detectors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Security Health Analytics</strong>: Finds misconfigurations based on best practices (CIS, NIST).</li>
    <li><strong>Qualys Cloud Security for SCC</strong>: Assesses OS-level and app vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud DLP</strong>: Detects sensitive data (e.g., PII, PCI) across GCP services.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud Security Scanner</strong>: Scans for vulnerabilities in web apps (e.g., XSS, outdated libraries).</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="q"><strong>Response Process</strong></div>
<div class="a">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1. Activate SCC</strong>: Set up SCC for your projects or entire organization. Ensure proper IAM roles are configured.</li>
    <li><strong>2. Enable Threat Detectors</strong>: Turn on detectors like Event Threat Detection, Cloud Anomaly Detection, and Qualys Cloud Security.</li>
    <li><strong>3. Monitoring Findings</strong>: SCC scans and generates findings based on active detectors. These include severity and the Attack Exposure Score (AE Score).</li>
    <li><strong>4. Automated Response with Cloud Functions</strong>: Findings trigger automated responses like isolating a VM or removing risky firewall rules using Cloud Functions via Pub/Sub.</li>
    <li><strong>5. Alert Notifications</strong>: SCC sends alerts through email, Slack, or SIEM systems to notify the security team of critical findings.</li>
    <li><strong>6. Incident Tracking</strong>: Log and track incidents in systems like Jira or ServiceNow for analysis and prioritization.</li>
    <li><strong>7. Remediation</strong>: Apply fixes, remove vulnerabilities, and update security policies regularly based on findings.</li>
    <li><strong>8. Compliance and Reporting</strong>: Ensure compliance with standards like CIS, NIST, and ISO 27001. Generate reports and export findings for analysis in BigQuery or Looker.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<div class="q"><strong>SCC detects a VM with SSH open to the internet</strong></div>
<div class="a">
  <ul>
    <li>1. SCC generates a critical finding: OPEN_FIREWALL.</li>
    <li>2. Finding sent to Pub/Sub.</li>
    <li>3. Cloud Function removes the risky firewall rule or isolates the VM.</li>
    <li>4. Notification sent to team (email, Slack, SIEM).</li>
    <li>5. Team analyzes, documents the issue, and adjusts policy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Automated response: SCC → Pub/Sub → Cloud Function → Response</p>
</div>

<div class="q"><strong>Public Cloud Storage Bucket</strong></div>
<div class="a">
  <p>Response: Remove public access or block with policy.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SCC detects bucket with public access (e.g., <code>allUsers</code>).</li>
    <li>Cloud Function removes public access using <code>gcloud storage buckets update</code>.</li>
    <li>Apply policy: <code>constraints/storage.publicAccessPrevention</code>.</li>
    <li>Notify the security team (Slack, Email).</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="q"><strong>Over-privileged Service Account</strong></div>
<div class="a">
  <p>Response: Revoke excessive permissions or alert IAM admin.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SCC finds over-privileged service account (e.g., Owner, Editor).</li>
    <li>Cloud Function removes risky IAM roles using <code>gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding</code>.</li>
    <li>Alert sent to IAM admin for further action.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

          <div class="a">

            <h1>IAM in GCP</h1>
            <p>Controls <span class="highlight">who</span> (<span class="highlight">identity</span>) can do <span class="highlight">what</span> (<span class="highlight">roles</span>) on which <span class="highlight">resource</span> in GCP</p>
            <p>Has the principle of <span class="important">Least Privilege</span> (*nobody should have more permissions than they need*) and <span class="important">Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</span> is a method of managing access to resources based on the roles assigned to users, groups, or service accounts.</p>
        
            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> GCP checks <span class="highlight">who</span> (user login, service account key, etc.) you are and then gives you <strong>authorization</strong> by checking <span class="highlight">what</span> <strong>IAM policies</strong> are attached to a resource and checks what are the <strong>roles</strong> assigned to you.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3><span class="highlight">who</span> - Identity</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Users:</strong> google accounts (`user@gmail.com`)</li>
                <li><strong>Service Accounts</strong> (svc account): Represent <span class="important">non-human entities</span>: applications, virtual machines (VMs), etc. that need to <em>authenticate and interact with Google Cloud resources</em> programmatically.</li>
                <li><strong>Groups:</strong> Collections of users (`engineers@domain.com`)</li>
                <li><strong>External Identities:</strong> Identities from external identity providers (e.g., Azure AD, custom identity providers)</li>
                <li><strong>Principals:</strong> Abstract representation of entities (`allUsers`, `allAuthenticatedUsers`, custom service account)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>The recommendation is always to work with groups where possible as individual users might leave the company, change teams, etc.</em></p>
        
            <h3><span class="highlight">what</span> - Access</h3>
            <p><strong>Roles</strong> = <span class="highlight">1 or more permissions</span>. Roles are attached to identities. They define what type of actions an identity can do.</p>
            <p>A user can have <strong>multiple roles</strong> for a <strong>single resource</strong>. When a user has multiple roles, the effective permissions are the <strong>union</strong> of the permissions granted by each role.</p>
        
            <h4 class="roles">Types of Roles</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primitive Roles:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Owner:</strong> Full access to all resources, including managing IAM policies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Editor:</strong> Can edit resources <span class="important">but cannot manage IAM policies.</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Viewer:</strong> Read-only access to resources.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Predefined Roles:</strong> Contain permissions for specific services and tasks.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Storage Admin:</strong> Full control over Cloud Storage resources. `roles/storage.admin`</li>
                        <li><strong>Compute Admin:</strong> Full control over Compute Engine resources. `roles/compute.instanceAdmin`</li>
                        <li><strong>BigQuery Data Editor:</strong> Full access to BigQuery datasets and tables `roles/bigquery.dataEditor`</li>
                        <li><strong>Kubernetes Engine Cluster Viewer:</strong> Read-only access to Kubernetes Engine clusters `roles/container.clusterViewer`</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Custom Roles:</strong> Use when predefined roles do not precisely match the access needs of your organization or project.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>E.g. Compute Admin role will give you the permissions to create virtual machines, networks, etc.</em> `roles/compute.admin`</p>
        
            <h3><span class="highlight">where</span> - Management</h3>
            <p><strong>Resources or IAM Objects</strong> are accessed by <strong>identities</strong> based on <strong>roles</strong> assigned to those identities.</p>
            <p>GCP resources are organized in a <strong>strict resource hierarchy</strong>. Every resource must have a project => projects creation is mandatory.</p>

            <h1><span style="color:rgb(236, 111, 9)">IAM Policy</span></h1>
            <p><strong>IAM Policy</strong> = <strong>list of rules</strong> called <strong>bindings</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each <strong>binding</strong> connects 1 or more identities (domain, user, group, svc account) to a specific <strong>role</strong> (contains permissions) on a specific <strong>resource</strong> (project, bucket, VM, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Policies</strong> can be defined at <strong>resource</strong> level, <strong>project</strong> level, <strong>folder</strong> level or <strong>organization</strong> level, depending on the type of resource.</li>
                <li>IAM policies are inherited from parent resources to child resources in GCP. 
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>E.g. if you set an IAM policy at the project level, all resources within that project inherit that policy unless explicitly overridden.</em></li>

          <div class="a">
            <h4>Cloud Armor - Protecting Applications on Google Cloud Platform</h4>
            <p><strong>Cloud Armor</strong> is a security service provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that helps protect applications from a variety of threats, particularly those from malicious web traffic. Its primary role is to safeguard applications deployed in GCP by filtering and blocking malicious requests before they reach the application.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Features and Role of Cloud Armor:</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>DDoS Protection</strong>: 
                    <p>Cloud Armor provides Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection to safeguard applications against large-scale attacks aimed at overwhelming resources. It leverages Google's global infrastructure to absorb and mitigate attacks at the network edge before they can reach the application.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Web Application Firewall (WAF)</strong>: 
                    <p>Cloud Armor integrates a WAF to protect applications from common web application attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other OWASP Top 10 threats. Users can define custom rules to block or allow traffic based on specific conditions like IP address, region, or request types.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Access Control</strong>: 
                    <p>Cloud Armor allows users to set rules based on various attributes, such as IP address, geography (region-based filtering), and request headers. This enables granular control over who can access the applications and helps ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: 
                    <p>The service is designed to scale automatically with your application’s needs. As the application grows or faces traffic spikes, Cloud Armor ensures that the level of protection adapts without requiring manual intervention.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Integration with Google Cloud Load Balancer</strong>: 
                    <p>Cloud Armor works seamlessly with Google Cloud's HTTP(S) Load Balancer to protect both global and regional applications deployed in GCP. This integration enables traffic to be filtered before it reaches the backend servers, ensuring that malicious traffic does not compromise the application.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Logging and Monitoring</strong>: 
                    <p>Cloud Armor provides detailed logs that track incoming requests, which help with security auditing, compliance, and troubleshooting. Integration with Google Cloud's operations suite (formerly Stackdriver) allows for real-time monitoring and alerting on suspicious activity.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Controlo de Acesso aos logs: IAM; Log Views (controls what type of logs to view)</li>
                <li>Only enable Data Access logging where needed to reduce noise.</li>
                <li>Prioritize logging for critical resources.</li>
                <li>Export logs to Cloud Storage or BigQuery for analytics.</li>
                <li>Set up log-based alerts.</li>
                <li>Maintain a retention policy of 30 days.</li>
                <li>Separate Admin Activity logs from Data Access logs.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Designing a Highly Available and Scalable Architecture in GCP</h4>
              <p>Creating a scalable and highly available architecture in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) involves using a combination of best practices and services. Below is a summarized approach:</p>
          
              <h4>Key Steps for a Highly Available and Scalable Architecture:</h4>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Global Load Balancer:</strong> Use a global load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple regions, ensuring high availability and reduced latency.</li>
                  <li><strong>Auto-Scaling Virtual Machines:</strong> Deploy virtual machine instances across multiple locations and regions with auto-scaling enabled to handle variable workloads efficiently.</li>
                  <li><strong>Managed Backend Services:</strong> Utilize GCP's managed services like Cloud SQL, BigQuery, and Firebase to handle backend operations, reducing maintenance overhead and increasing scalability.</li>
                  <li><strong>Content Delivery:</strong> Use Cloud Storage in combination with the Cloud Content Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver content globally, improving performance and scalability.</li>
                  <li><strong>Monitoring and Logging:</strong> Implement Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring for routine upkeep, to continuously monitor the infrastructure, and to proactively address any performance issues.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p>By leveraging these services, you can ensure that your GCP infrastructure is both scalable and highly available, meeting the demands of modern applications.</p>

              VPC permite configurar várias subnets created across multiple regions. </br>
              

              <p><strong>VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)</strong> is a secure, private and isolated network within Google Cloud.</p>
              E.g. 1 subnet to hospedate the website (public subnte) => configurar a virtual network gateway and the other one (private subnet) to hospedate the database (has sensitive information, should not be accessed from outside) . </br>
              <h4>Allows to </h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Deploy and connect resources (VMs, containers, databases, etc.)</li>
                <li>Create network traffic with firewalls rules, routes and peering</li>
                <li>Define IP address ranges and subnets</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Features</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Subnetes (regional IP range to organize and isolate resources)</li>
                <li>Global Scope - 1 VPN can span multiple regions</li>
                <li>Custom routes: Control how traffic flows internally and externally                </li>
                <li>Firewall rules: Allow/deny traffic based on IPs, ports, tags, or service accounts                </li>
                <li>Peering: Connect VPCs privately (same org or cross-org) </li>
                <li>Shared VPC: Share a VPC network across multiple projects for centralized control</li>
                <li><strong>VPN:</strong> Connect securely to on-premises networks.</li>
                <li><strong>NAT:</strong> Allows internet access with private IPs.</li>
                <li><strong>Security</strong> Data and applications are isolated from the clients on the public cloud.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability</strong> Can dynamic change quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost effective</strong> No need to spend money in hardware</li>

                <li><strong>High Availability:</strong> Ensure fault tolerance across zones.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Acesso seguro à G-cloud</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Authorized user accounts with IAM permissions</li>
                <li>2FA</li>
                <li>Avoid public networds </li>
                <li>Use service account with low privileges</li>

              <h3>Shared VPC network</h5>
              Allows multiple  projects to share the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network centrally and securely.
              <ul>
                <li>The network is created in a <strong>host project</strong>, and other  <strong>service projects</strong> can use it to deploy their resources (VMs, containers, etc.)</li>
              </ul>

              <h6>Benefits of a Shared VPC in Google Cloud</h6>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Centralized network management</strong> – All VPC resources like subnets, firewall rules, and routes are managed in a single host project.</li>
              <li><strong>Improved security</strong> – Central control over IAM, firewall rules, and monitoring reduces misconfigurations and security gaps.</li>
              <li><strong>Separation of concerns</strong> – Teams can work in separate service projects while sharing the same secure network infrastructure.</li>
              <li><strong>Better scalability</strong> – Easily scale your cloud environment across teams and departments using a shared network.</li>
              <li><strong>Cost efficiency</strong> – Shared networking avoids duplication of resources and makes cost tracking per project easier.</li>
              <li><strong>Compliance & audit readiness</strong> – Easier to enforce and track security/compliance policies centrally (e.g., firewall audits, traffic logging).</li>
              <li><strong>Simplified VPC peering</strong> – Reduces the need for complex VPC peering between projects by using a single shared network.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="a">
              <h1>What is a Firewall Rule in GCP?</h1>

              <p>A <strong>firewall rule</strong> in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a set of conditions used to control the inbound and outbound traffic to and from <strong>Virtual Machine (VM) instances</strong> within a <strong>VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)</strong> network.</p>
            
              <h2>Key Points:</h2>
              <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Traffic Control:</strong> Firewall rules control which traffic is allowed or denied to VM instances based on defined parameters like IP address, port, and protocol.</li>
                  <li><strong>Direction:</strong> Rules apply to either incoming traffic (<em>ingress</em>) or outgoing traffic (<em>egress</em>).</li>
                  <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Can be applied to specific instances or all instances in a network.</li>
                  <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> GCP evaluates the rules top-down; the first matching rule is applied.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            
              <h2>Common Components of Firewall Rules:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Source/Destination IP:</strong> Defines the source or destination IP addresses allowed for traffic.</li>
                <li><strong>Ports and Protocols:</strong> Specifies which ports (e.g., 80, 443) and protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP) are allowed.</li>
                <li><strong>Action:</strong> Can be <strong>allow</strong> or <strong>deny</strong> traffic matching the rule.</li>
                <li><strong>Priority:</strong> Each rule has a priority number; lower numbers have higher priority.</li>
              </ul>
            
              <h2>Example:</h2>
              <p>A firewall rule that allows HTTP traffic (port 80) from any source (0.0.0.0/0) to your VMs would look like this:</p>
              <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Source IP Range:</strong> 0.0.0.0/0 (any IP)</li>
                  <li><strong>Allowed Protocol/Port:</strong> TCP port 80</li>
                  <li><strong>Action:</strong> Allow</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            
              <h2>How It Works:</h2>
              <p>When a request is made to a VM instance, the firewall rule is evaluated based on the source and destination IP addresses, protocol, and port. If the rule matches and allows the traffic, it proceeds to the VM. Otherwise, the traffic is blocked.</p>
            
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> This control is essential for securing cloud-based resources and ensuring that only authorized traffic reaches the VM instances.</p>

            <div class="q"> Proactive vs Reactive Security Practices</div>
            <div class="a">
              <h2>🛡️ Proactive Security Practices</h2>
              <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Prevent incidents before they occur.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>IAM Least Privilege:</strong> Only grant the minimum necessary permissions (e.g., use <code>Storage Viewer</code> instead of <code>Editor</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous scanning with SCC:</strong> Detect misconfigurations like open firewalls or public buckets before they’re exploited.</li>
                <li><strong>VPC Service Controls:</strong> Restrict data movement to reduce the risk of data exfiltration.</li>
                <li><strong>Binary Authorization (for GKE):</strong> Enforce signed and verified container images only.</li>
                <li><strong>Organization Policies:</strong> Prevent creation of insecure resources (e.g., public buckets, unmanaged disks).</li>
                <li><strong>Vulnerability scanning:</strong> Scan container images for CVEs before deployment using Container Analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>CI/CD security gates:</strong> Block code with vulnerabilities or policy violations from reaching production.</li>
              </ul>
            
              <h2>🚨 Reactive Security Practices</h2>
              <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Detect and respond to incidents when they occur.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>SCC finding triggers automation:</strong> Use Pub/Sub and Cloud Functions to isolate VMs or remove risky firewall rules automatically.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident response runbooks:</strong> Predefined steps for responding to security events (e.g., disable access, notify teams, collect logs).</li>
                <li><strong>Event Threat Detection:</strong> Real-time detection of malware, port scanning, and other anomalies in GCP logs.</li>
                <li><strong>Log analysis and forensics:</strong> Use tools like Chronicle or BigQuery to investigate suspicious activity after an incident.</li>
                <li><strong>Audit logs and Access Transparency:</strong> Track who did what, when, and where inside your environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Backup and disaster recovery:</strong> Recover compromised or lost data (e.g., after a ransomware attack).</li>
              </ul>
