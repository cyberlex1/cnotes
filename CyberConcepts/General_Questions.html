                    <div class="q">Tell me about yourself</div>
                    <div class="a">I have experience across various cybersecurity domains. I'm someone who is constantly driven to learn and grow, and I embrace change and new responsibilities with enthusiasm. When I don’t know the answer to a problem, I take the initiative to learn and figure it out. I enjoy working collaboratively in a team, but I’m also comfortable working independently. To continuously improve my cybersecurity knowledge, I actively participate in industry conferences, pursue cyber certifications, and take part in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. Outside of work, I value spending quality time with family and friends, going to the cinema, staying active through cycling and running, and reading a good book.</div>
              
                    <div class="q">How is your day in cybersecurity?</div>
                    <div class="a">

                        <strong>How is your day in cybersecurity?</strong><br>
                        <p>My day typically starts with daily team meetings where we discuss ongoing tasks and priorities. Occasionally, I have meetings with clients to provide updates or address specific concerns. My tasks vary, as I work on penetration testing, vulnerability management, and security assessments, depending on current needs. I usually balance proactive security measures with addressing ongoing incidents or vulnerabilities.</p>
            
                        <strong>How do you prioritize tasks?</strong><br>
                        <p>I prioritize tasks by assessing the risk and urgency. If there's an active vulnerability or high-risk issue, it gets my immediate attention. I also consider any deadlines or client requests for penetration tests or assessments. For routine tasks like vulnerability management, I follow a structured process, addressing the most critical vulnerabilities first based on CVSS scores or system exposure.</p>
