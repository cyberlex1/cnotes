                    <p>
                        I hold a <strong>Bachelor’s Degree in Informatics Engineering</strong> from the University of Aveiro (UA), where I built a solid foundation in computer science. Throughout the program, I explored topics such as software engineering, operating systems, databases, and artificial intelligence. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also hold a <strong>Master’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering</strong> from Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), Lisbon, with a specialization in <strong>Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence</strong>. This gave me the opportunity to dive deeper into areas like secure systems, ethical hacking, cryptography, and machine learning. I graduated with distinction, achieving a final grade of <strong>17 out of 20</strong>.
                        My master’s thesis, "The Role of Facial Emotions in Usability Evaluation," involved handling sensitive visual and audio data. I ensured GDPR compliance by anonymizing and encrypting data, storing it on encrypted servers with restricted access to protect user privacy. I had a final grade of 19 out of 20              </p>

                      <p>
                        In 2018, I took a gap year between secondary school and university to work in Switzerland’s viniculture industry, where I learned the value of building strong customer relationships.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In the summer of 2023, I completed a Data Analyst internship at Sky Portugal, where I developed an ETL pipeline in Python to extract data from New Relic, apply transformations such as normalization, cleaning, and type conversion, and load it into Google Cloud’s BigQuery. I then built dashboards in Looker Studio, which were used by managers to support data-driven decision-making.

                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Since september 2023 as a cybersecurity engineer I've been working across different cybersecurity fields and industry areas (Customer Service Outsourcing,  Financial Services, Energy and Infrastructure and Transportation). 
                        
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            I have  experience in <span style="color: #d9534f;">DevSecOps</span> exercises, where I integrated Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and Static, Dynamic, and Interactive Application Security Testing tools into a vulnerability management platform, such as DefectDojo. DefectDojo is built using Django framework. This integration enabled vulnerability management, enhancing the overall security posture of applications throughout the Software Development Life Cycle <li>
                            <p>
                              I was involved in <span style="color: #d9534f;">Threat Modeling</span>  projects to support the creation of an Information Security Management Systems (ISMSs)</strong> according with <strong>ISO 27001 requirements</strong>.<br>
                              I also supported my company's <strong>ISO 27001 certification process</strong> by <strong>performing threat modeling</strong> on the <strong>technology-related security controls (Annex A, A.8)</strong>, <strong>identifying and classifying the company's information assets</strong>, and <strong>analyzing potential threats and vulnerabilities</strong> to propose appropriate risk mitigation measures.
                            </p>
                                                      </li>
                          <li>
                            I performed <strong>Social Engineering attacks</strong> using GoPhish to evaluate security awareness and detect human vulnerabilities within organizations.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            I have experience in  <span style="color: #d9534f;">Vulnerability Assessment and Management</span>, where I have been responsible for identifying, evaluating, and mitigating vulnerabilities across various IT systems and environments. This includes conducting regular vulnerability scans, prioritizing remediation efforts based on risk levels, and coordinating with teams to implement patching and fixes. 
                            I used tools like Nexpose, Kiuwan, Qualys, BurpSuite, Nessus, BlackDuck, Seeker, Polaris, SonarQube, Coverity and vulnerability management tools like DefectDojo.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            I have hands-on experience in <span style="color: #d9534f;">Penetration Testing</span>   for networks, web applications, infrastructure, and AI models. I'm familiar with Black, Grey, and White Box testing, using methodologies like OWASP and PTES. I work with a wide range of tools such as Nessus, OpenVAS, Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite, Kali Linux, Wireshark and SQLmap to identify and fix vulnerabilities. Additionally, I hold recognized offensive cybersecurity certifications that have significantly enhanced my expertise in the field.                          </li>
                         
                          <li>
                            I completed the <strong>learning path for the Professional Cloud Network and Security Engineer certification on Google Cloud</strong>. Although I did not have the opportunity to directly participate in cloud projects due to the prioritization of initiatives in other areas within the company, I continued to deepen my knowledge and prepare to implement these practices in future opportunities.                          </li>
                          <li>
                            I have collaborated with the <strong>GRC team</strong> to support <strong>ISO 27001</strong> initiatives and apply <strong>security best practices</strong> across cloud-based infrastructures.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            So, I’ve been working in different types of projects, and I strive to learn a little more about cybersecurity every day. I enjoy being part of challenging projects and working in teams, as it allows me to learn a lot while also helping the company grow.

            <div class="q">🛠️ How to Create Analytics Rules in Microsoft Sentinel</div>
<div class="a">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1. Go to Microsoft Sentinel</strong> → Open the workspace you're working on.</li>
    <li><strong>2. Navigate to "Analytics"</strong> → Click "Create" to start a new rule.</li>
    <li><strong>3. Choose Rule Type</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scheduled rule</strong>: Runs on a fixed interval using KQL queries</li>
        <li><strong>Microsoft Security rule</strong>: Based on alerts from Defender tools</li>
        <li><strong>Fusion rule</strong>: Uses ML to detect multi-stage attacks (prebuilt)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>4. Define Rule Details</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>Name, description, severity (High, Medium, Low, Informational)</li>
        <li>Tactics from MITRE ATT&CK</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>5. Write KQL Query</strong> – Query the logs to detect suspicious patterns</li>
    <li><strong>6. Set Rule Logic</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>Set frequency (e.g., every 5 min)</li>
        <li>Set lookup period (e.g., last 1 hour)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>7. Incident Settings</strong> – Decide if alerts create incidents automatically</li>
    <li><strong>8. Alert Grouping</strong> – Group alerts by user, IP, or event type</li>
    <li><strong>9. Add Automation (Optional)</strong> – Attach a Playbook to auto-respond</li>
    <li><strong>10. Review & Create</strong> – Confirm settings and enable the rule</li>
  </ul>
