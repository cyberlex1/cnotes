   <p>Detect, prevent, and remove malicious software (malware)</p>

      <li><strong>Types of Malware:</strong>
          <ul>
              <li>Viruses: Programs that replicate and spread between files or systems.</li>
              <li>Trojans: Malicious software disguised as legitimate programs.</li>
              <li>Worms: Spreads automatically across networks.</li>
              <li>Spyware: Collects information without the user’s knowledge.</li>
              <li>Ransomware: Encrypts data and demands payment for decryption.</li>
              <li>Adware: Software that displays unwanted advertisements.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Types of AV Software:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Signature-Based Detection: Detects malware based on known virus signatures in the AV’s database.</li>
            <li>Heuristic Detection: Analyzes the behavior of programs to detect new or unknown threats by their actions.</li>
            <li>Cloud-Based AV: Uses cloud-based technology to offload malware detection and analysis, providing more up-to-date protection.</li>
            <li>Real-Time Protection: Provides ongoing monitoring of system activities to block threats as soon as they are detected.</li>
            <li>On-Demand Scanners: Allows users to scan their system manually at any time for potential threats.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

      <li><strong>How to Handle an Incident from AV:</strong>
          <ul>
              <li>When an AV detects a potential threat, it typically isolates the suspicious file to prevent it from spreading.</li>
              <li>The Blue Team should investigate the alert, determine the scope of the attack, and perform forensic analysis to understand the attack vector.</li>
              <li>If the incident is confirmed as a legitimate threat, steps should be taken to remove the malware and restore the affected systems from clean backups.</li>
              <li>The incident should be logged, and lessons learned should be shared with the team to improve future detection and response.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Main Features of AV Software:</strong>
          <ul>
              <li>Real-Time Detection: Continuous monitoring of files and processes to detect and block threats as they occur.</li>
              <li>File Scanning: Scanning files stored on devices for malware.</li>
              <li>Quarantine: Isolating suspicious files to prevent them from harming the system.</li>
              <li>Automatic Updates: AV software automatically updates virus definitions to detect new and emerging threats.</li>
              <li>Web and Email Protection: Scanning links, email attachments, and websites for malicious content.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>

              <div class="q">> IAM vs ACL  </div>
              <div class="a">   
              
              IAM (Identity and Access Management): Manages user access and permissions centrally, often used in cloud environments (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS). It uses roles and policies to control access. </br>

ACL (Access Control List): Defines specific permissions for users on individual resources like files or network devices. It’s simpler and resource-specific.
                </div>

            <p>ACLs manage user access to systems. The JML process ensures that access is granted, modified, or revoked based on employment status.</p>
            
            <h3>JML Process</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Joiners:</strong> New employees are given access based on their role.</li>
              <li><strong>Movers:</strong> Employees changing roles have their access updated.</li>
              <li><strong>Leavers:</strong> Employees leaving have their access removed.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Best Practices</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Automate updates to ACLs to prevent errors.</li>
              <li><strong>Least Privilege:</strong> Grant only the minimum necessary access.</li>

              <p>This involves tracking, prioritizing, and resolving security-related tickets and requests raised by colleagues to ensure a secure work environment.</p>

<h3>Key Steps for Managing Security Tickets</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1. Ticket Creation:</strong> 
    <p>Colleagues raise security-related tickets (e.g., access requests, suspicious activity reports, system vulnerabilities). Tools like Jira, ServiceNow, or Zendesk may be used.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>2. Ticket Categorization:</strong> 
    <p>Classify tickets based on urgency and type (e.g., incident, request, vulnerability). This helps in assigning priority.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>3. Prioritization:</strong> 
    <p>Determine the priority of tickets. Critical security incidents (e.g., breaches or vulnerabilities) should be handled first, followed by less urgent requests.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>4. Investigation and Resolution:</strong> 
    <p>Analyze the issue in the ticket (e.g., malware alerts, access issues), take corrective action, and resolve it. This may involve collaborating with other teams (e.g., IT, development).</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>5. Communication:</strong> 
    <p>Regularly update the ticket submitter on the status and resolution. Clear communication helps keep users informed and satisfied.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>6. Documentation:</strong> 
    <p>Document the process and steps taken to resolve the issue. This helps in future troubleshooting and compliance audits.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>7. Ticket Closure:</strong> 
    <p>Once the issue is resolved, close the ticket and mark it as completed. Ensure that the requester confirms the issue is fixed before closure.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>8. Review and Improvement:</strong> 
    <p>Review recurring issues or trends to improve security policies, practices, and systems. Identify areas where proactive measures can be introduced.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Steps with Examples</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1. Preparation:</strong> 
    <p>Example: A company sets up an Incident Response Plan (IRP), deploys SIEM systems for monitoring, and trains its staff on how to react to common threats like phishing or malware.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>2. Detection:</strong> 
    <p>Example: A SOC team detects suspicious activity through their SIEM tool, which shows multiple failed login attempts from an unfamiliar IP address, indicating a possible brute force attack.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>3. Containment:</strong> 
    <p>Example: The team isolates the compromised system by disconnecting it from the network, preventing the attacker from moving laterally to other devices or systems.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>4. Eradication:</strong> 
    <p>Example: After identifying the malicious software, such as ransomware, the team removes the malware from all affected systems and patches the exploited vulnerability.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>5. Recovery:</strong> 
    <p>Example: The IT team restores data from secure backups and ensures all systems are clean before bringing them back online, verifying that the attack is fully neutralized.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>6. Lessons Learned:</strong> 
    <p>Example: After the incident, the team holds a debriefing session, analyzes what went well and what could have been handled better, and updates the Incident Response Plan to improve future responses.</p>

                <div class="q">Authentication vs Authorization</div>
<div class="a">
  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Definition</h5>
  <p> Authorization determines what actions or resources a user is allowed to access</p>
  <p><span style="color:rgb(0, 112, 192)">Authentication</span> is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be. There are three main types of authentication:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Something you know:</strong> Such as a password or the answer to a security question. These are sometimes called "knowledge factors".</li>
    <li><strong>Something you have:</strong> This is a physical object such as a mobile phone or security token. These are sometimes called "possession factors".</li>
    <li><strong>Something you are:</strong> For example, your biometrics or patterns of behavior. These are sometimes called "inherence factors".</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span style="color:rgb(0, 112, 192)">Authorization</span> involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something, and is often combined with authentication for comprehensive access control.</p>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">How/Where to Detect</h5>
  <p>Authentication vulnerabilities can be detected during penetration testing, code reviews, and automated security scans. Tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP can help test the authentication flow and identify weaknesses such as weak password policies, missing MFA, or insecure session management. It is important to also test for issues like session hijacking and improper access controls.</p>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Mitigation</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an additional layer of security beyond just a password.</li>
    <li>Implement rate-limiting and CAPTCHA on login forms to prevent brute-force attacks.</li>
    <li>Encourage users to use unique, strong passwords for different sites or services.</li>
    <li>Ensure proper session management by using secure cookies with the <code>HttpOnly</code> and <code>Secure</code> flags to protect session tokens.</li>
    <li>Prevent session hijacking by using HTTPS for secure data transmission.</li>
    <li>Fix logic flaws and poor coding practices in the authentication and authorization processes.</li>
    <li>Improve password recovery functionality with proper validation and security measures to avoid exploitation.</li>
    <li>Ensure that session durations are appropriately short to limit exposure.</li>
    <li>Incorporate strong encryption methods to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.</li>
    <li>Enforce the use of MFA and adequate encryption for sensitive data exchanges.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Types</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Password-Based Authentication:</strong> The most common form, where users provide a username and password to authenticate.</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Enhances security by requiring two or more forms of authentication (e.g., something you know, something you have, or something you are).</li>
    <li><strong>Token-Based Authentication:</strong> Relies on tokens (e.g., JWT, OAuth tokens) instead of passwords. Commonly used for API authentication and single sign-on (SSO) systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Biometric Authentication:</strong> Uses unique physiological traits (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition) for authentication.</li>
    <li><strong>Certificate-Based Authentication:</strong> Uses digital certificates to authenticate users or systems in secure communications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Example</h5>
  <pre>POST /api/v1/login
{
  "username": "user1",
  "password": "securePassword123"
}
Response: 200 OK, { "token": "jwt-token" }</pre>
  <p>In this example, a user sends their username and password to authenticate and receives a token in response. This token can then be used for accessing protected resources.</p>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">HTTP Security Header</h5>
  <p>Authentication can be enhanced using headers such as <code>Authorization</code> (for token-based systems) and <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> for challenges in HTTP requests. Additionally, ensuring <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> (HSTS) is enabled helps secure the transmission of sensitive authentication data.</p>

              <div class="a">
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Asset:</strong> Anything of value to an organization (e.g., data, systems, people).</li>
                <li><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> A weakness that could be exploited by a threat.</li>
                <li><strong>Threat:</strong> A potential event or actor that can exploit a vulnerability.</li>

              <div class="q">API Testing</div>
<div class="a">
  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Definition</h5>
  <p>API Testing refers to the process of testing application programming interfaces (APIs) to ensure they function correctly and securely. This includes validating response accuracy, performance, and security vulnerabilities such as injection, authentication failures, and more.</p>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">How/Where to Detect</h5>
  <p>API testing is often done using tools like Postman, Burp Suite, or OWASP ZAP. It involves sending requests to API endpoints, analyzing responses, and testing for common vulnerabilities like input validation, authentication, and data exposure. Automated scripts or manual exploration are both commonly used methods.</p>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Mitigation</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure proper input validation and sanitation to prevent injection attacks.</li>
    <li>Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as OAuth, JWT, and API keys.</li>
    <li>Use HTTPS for secure data transmission and protect data in transit.</li>
    <li>Rate limit API requests to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.</li>
    <li>Utilize API gateways for additional protection and monitoring.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Types</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Functional Testing:</strong> Ensures the API performs its intended functions correctly (e.g., checking if an API returns the correct data when a valid request is made).</li>
    <li><strong>Security Testing:</strong> Verifies that the API is secure, handling authentication, authorization, and sensitive data properly (e.g., testing for SQL injection, data leaks, and access control vulnerabilities).</li>
    <li><strong>Load Testing:</strong> Verifies the API's performance under various levels of load (e.g., checking how the API handles high traffic or stress).</li>
    <li><strong>Error Handling Testing:</strong> Tests how the API responds to invalid or erroneous inputs (e.g., incorrect parameters, unauthorized requests).</li>
    <li><strong>Boundary Testing:</strong> Tests the API by providing input at boundary or edge conditions (e.g., maximum length of input).</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Example</h5>
  <pre>POST /api/v1/login
{
  "username": "user1",
  "password": "pass1234"
}
Response: 200 OK, { "token": "jwt-token" }</pre>
  <p>If an API endpoint doesn't properly authenticate the user, it could lead to unauthorized access.</p>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">HTTP Security Header</h5>
  <p>Ensure APIs use security headers like <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code>, <code>X-Content-Type-Options</code>, and <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> to enhance security. <code>Authorization</code> headers should also be used to enforce proper authentication.</p>

                <p>IP --> MAC within a local network. </p>

                  <li>A device wants to send data to an IP (e.g., 192.168.1.5).</li>
                  <li>It broadcasts an ARP request on the network asking:<br>
                      <em>"Who has IP 192.168.1.5? Tell me your MAC address."</em>
                  </li>
                  <li>The target device replies with its MAC address.</li>
                  <li>The sender stores this info in its ARP cache and sends the packet.</li>

<p><strong>Base64 Encoding:</strong> Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. It is commonly used in email encoding, data transmission, and file storage.</p>

<p><strong>Base64URL Encoding:</strong> Base64URL is a URL-safe variant of Base64 encoding, where the characters `+` and `/` are replaced by `-` and `_` respectively. It is used for web applications to avoid issues with URL encoding, such as when embedding binary data in URL paths, query strings, or HTTP headers.</p>

              <div class="q">Brute Force Attack</div>
<div class="a">
  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Definition</h5>
  <p>A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used by attackers to guess passwords, encryption keys, or other sensitive data by systematically testing every possible combination until the correct one is found.</p>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">How/Where to Detect</h5>
  <p>Brute force attacks can be detected by monitoring failed login attempts, especially when the number of failures exceeds a certain threshold. Other indicators include high traffic volumes directed at authentication pages or systems, which might suggest repeated login attempts.</p>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Mitigation</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts.</li>
    <li>Use CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA on login forms to deter automated attacks.</li>
    <li>Enforce strong password policies (e.g., requiring a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols).</li>
    <li>Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of protection.</li>
    <li>Implement rate limiting or delay login attempts to slow down brute force attacks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Types</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>**Simple Brute Force**: Trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found.</li>
    <li>**Dictionary Attack**: Using a list of commonly used passwords (dictionary words) to guess the correct password.</li>
    <li>**Hybrid Attack**: A combination of brute force and dictionary attacks, where common passwords are tested with variations (e.g., adding numbers or special characters).</li>
    <li>**Credential Stuffing**: Using stolen username and password combinations from previous breaches to attempt login on other services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Example</h5>
  <p>An attacker might attempt to access an account on a website by using a script that tries every possible combination of characters for the password field, systematically entering each combination until they find the correct one. If the attacker uses a dictionary of common passwords, they might only need to try a few hundred or thousand combinations before succeeding.</p>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">HTTP Security Header</h5>
  <p>HTTP security headers can help mitigate brute force attacks by adding additional layers of protection. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>X-Frame-Options</strong>: Prevents clickjacking attacks that could be used in conjunction with brute force attempts to trick users into submitting their credentials.</li>
    <li><strong>Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)</strong>: Forces the use of HTTPS to secure login credentials from being intercepted during brute force attacks.</li>
    <li><strong>X-Content-Type-Options</strong>: Prevents MIME type sniffing, which could help mitigate some types of attacks where brute force attempts target vulnerable content types.</li>
    <li><strong>Content-Security-Policy (CSP)</strong>: Reduces the risk of XSS attacks, which could assist an attacker trying to exploit vulnerabilities to facilitate brute force attacks.</li>
  </ul>

              Cryptography is the overall science and study of securing communication and data.<br>
              Encryption is one of the tools or techniques used within cryptography to protect data confidentiality.

              <div class="q"><strong> CVE, CWE, CVSS, and SLA</strong></div>
              <div class="a">
                <div class="mtb">

                  <p><strong>CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):</strong> A unique identifier for publicly known vulnerabilities.  
                  Example: <code>CVE-2021-34527</code> refers to the "PrintNightmare" vulnerability in Windows.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration):</strong> A catalog of software weaknesses that lead to vulnerabilities.  
                  Example: <code>CWE-89</code> is "SQL Injection," a weakness in handling user input safely in SQL queries.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):</strong> A score to measure the severity of a vulnerability.  
                  Example: A CVE might have a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating it is critical (e.g., remote code execution).</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>How CVSS is Calculated:</strong> CVSS is calculated based on several factors, which are grouped into three categories:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Base Score:</strong> Measures the intrinsic severity of the vulnerability (e.g., impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability).</li>
                    <li><strong>Temporal Score:</strong> Measures the current exploitability of the vulnerability (e.g., known exploits, fix availability).</li>
                    <li><strong>Environmental Score:</strong> Measures the specific impact to the organization based on their environment.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p><strong>Calculation Formula:</strong> CVSS Base Score = (Impact + Exploitability) * Temporal * Environmental factors. CVSS is generally calculated using a formula that factors in things like how easily the vulnerability can be exploited (Exploitability), the impact it has on the system (Impact), and the availability of mitigations or fixes.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>SLA (Service Level Agreement):</strong> Defines the expected time for resolving a vulnerability.  
                  Example: "Fix the vulnerability within 48 hours" or "Resolution in next monthly patch cycle."</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>The sender creates a hash of the message and encrypts it with their private key.</li>

                <br>Then a TLS handshake (encryption protocols, exchanges keys, to establish a secure connection). 
                <br>Finally the browser sends an HTTP GET to “/” to the server and gets a 200 OK.

                <strong>Diffie-Hellman (DH)</strong> is a cryptographic protocol used for secure key exchange over an insecure communication channel. The key idea behind Diffie-Hellman is that two parties can securely establish a shared secret key without directly transmitting it, even though the communication channel is not secure.<br>
                Diffie-Hellman is secure because the process of deriving the shared secret from the public keys is mathematically difficult, relying on the hard-to-solve Discrete Logarithm Problem.

                <h4>Salting</h4>
              
                  <p><strong>Salting</strong> is the process of adding a random string (salt) to a password before hashing it. This makes each password hash unique, even if two users have the same password.</p>

                  <h4>Why Use Salting?</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Prevents rainbow table attacks (precomputed hash lookups).</li>
                    <li>Makes it harder to detect duplicate passwords across users.</li>
                    <li>Enhances the security of stored password hashes.</li>
                  </ul>

              <div class="q">GraphQL API vulnerabilities</div>
              <div class="a">
                <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Definition</h5>
                <p>GraphQL is an API query language that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, but it introduces unique security challenges. Vulnerabilities in GraphQL APIs can occur due to improper query validation, excessive data exposure, or lack of access control.</p>

                <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">How/Where to Detect</h5>
                <p>GraphQL vulnerabilities can be detected by reviewing the queries and mutations allowed by the API. Security issues can also be identified using tools like fuzzers or automated security scanners that target GraphQL endpoints.</p>

                <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Mitigation</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Implement strict input validation and query complexity analysis to prevent abusive queries.</li>
                  <li>Limit the depth of queries to prevent Deep Query attacks.</li>
                  <li>Apply proper authentication and authorization for every query and mutation.</li>
                  <li>Avoid overexposing sensitive data by implementing fine-grained access control.</li>
                  <li>Use tools like GraphQL Shield or Apollo Server to secure the API layer.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Types</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Excessive Data Exposure</li>
                  <li>Unvalidated Input</li>
                  <li>Query Depth Attacks</li>
                  <li>Authorization Failures</li>
                  <li>Denial of Service (DoS) via complex queries</li>
                </ul>

                <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Example</h5>
                <p>Example of a vulnerable GraphQL query:</p>
                <pre>
                  query {
                    users {
                      id
                      name
                      email
                      password  <!-- Sensitive data exposure -->
                    }
                  }
                </pre>
                <p>In this example, the "password" field is exposed, which could lead to a data breach.</p>

                <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">HTTP Security Header</h5>
                <p>No specific HTTP header for GraphQL, but common headers like <code>X-Content-Type-Options</code> and <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> help reduce vulnerabilities related to content type sniffing and cross-site scripting (XSS) respectively.</p>

              <div class="q">HTTP Request Smuggling</div>
<div class="a">
  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Definition</h5>
  <p>HTTP Request Smuggling occurs when an attacker exploits discrepancies between how different components of a system (e.g., web servers, proxies) interpret HTTP requests. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as bypassing security mechanisms, unauthorized access, or response splitting.</p>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">How/Where to Detect</h5>
  <p>Detection typically involves analyzing the interaction between different layers (e.g., proxy, web server, backend) and how they process HTTP requests. This can be detected by sending specially crafted HTTP requests and observing abnormal server responses.</p>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Mitigation</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure proper configuration and synchronization of proxies and backend servers to handle HTTP requests uniformly.</li>
    <li>Validate and sanitize HTTP request headers to ensure no ambiguous request formats can bypass the system.</li>
    <li>Use a single HTTP parser for all components to avoid discrepancies.</li>
    <li>Implement security mechanisms like input validation, rate limiting, and logging for unusual requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Types</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Request Smuggling between front-end proxies and back-end servers.</li>
    <li>HTTP request splitting attacks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Example</h5>
  <p>Example of an HTTP Request Smuggling attack:</p>
  <pre>
    POST / HTTP/1.1
    Host: victim.com
    Content-Length: 13
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    X-Forwarded-For: <attacker_ip>

    0\r\n\r\nPOST /evil HTTP/1.1
    Host: victim.com
  </pre>
  <p>In this example, the attacker sends a request that is interpreted differently by the front-end proxy and the back-end server, potentially allowing malicious requests to bypass security measures.</p>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">HTTP Security Header</h5>
  <p>No specific HTTP header for HTTP Request Smuggling prevention, but headers like <code>Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)</code> can be used to ensure secure connections and mitigate attacks on the transport layer.</p>

                 <div class="a">
                   <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Definition</h5>
                   <p>Insecure deserialization occurs when an attacker manipulates serialized data to execute arbitrary code, gain unauthorized access, or perform other malicious activities. It is common in applications that accept serialized objects from untrusted sources without proper validation or integrity checks.</p>
                 
                   <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">How/Where to Detect</h5>
                   <p>Insecure deserialization can be detected by analyzing how serialized data is handled, especially when it's coming from untrusted sources. Look for unprotected deserialization routines in the application code and monitor for unusual deserialization requests or errors in logs.</p>
                 
                   <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Mitigation</h5>
                   <ul>
                     <li>Implement proper input validation to reject or sanitize untrusted serialized data.</li>
                     <li>Use strong encryption and signing of serialized data to prevent tampering.</li>
                     <li>Avoid deserializing objects from untrusted sources whenever possible.</li>
                     <li>Implement access controls to restrict access to sensitive deserialization routines.</li>
                     <li>Use safe deserialization libraries that check the integrity of the data.</li>
                   </ul>
                 
                   <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Types</h5>
                   <ul>
                     <li>Object injection attacks</li>
                     <li>Remote code execution (RCE) through deserialization</li>
                     <li>Privilege escalation by tampering with serialized data</li>
                   </ul>
                 
                   <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Example</h5>
                   <p>Example of insecure deserialization:</p>
                   <pre>
                     <?php
                     // Example of unsafe deserialization
                     $data = unserialize($_POST['user_data']);
                     ?>
                   </pre>
                   <p>In this example, an attacker could send manipulated serialized data in the `user_data` parameter, potentially executing arbitrary code during the deserialization process.</p>
                 
                   <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">HTTP Security Header</h5>
                   <p>Although there are no specific HTTP headers for mitigating insecure deserialization, using secure headers like <code>X-Content-Type-Options</code> and <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> may reduce the impact of other related attacks like code injection.</p>

                 <div class="q">Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)</div>
                 <div class="a">
                  <p><strong>Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)</strong> are signs that a system or network has been compromised by a cyberattack. Monitoring these indicators helps organizations detect and respond to security breaches quickly.</p>
                  <h4>Common IOCs to Monitor:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Unusual Network Traffic:</strong> Unexpected spikes or patterns in traffic, often indicating data exfiltration or malware communication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unauthorized Logins:</strong> Multiple failed login attempts, or logins from unfamiliar locations or devices, can indicate a brute-force attack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Changes in File Integrity:</strong> Unexpected modifications to critical system files, including system configurations or executable files.</li>
                    <li><strong>Suspicious Processes:</strong> Malicious or unauthorized processes running in the background, which can indicate the presence of malware.</li>
                    <li><strong>New or Unknown User Accounts:</strong> Creation of new user accounts without authorization, often used to escalate privileges.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Resource Usage:</strong> Unexplained high CPU or memory usage, which could be caused by a malware infection or resource-intensive attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unusual Outbound Communications:</strong> Unexpected outbound communications, especially to foreign or unrecognized IP addresses, can signal a data breach or exfiltration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Presence of Malware Signatures:</strong> Detection of known malicious files, URLs, or hash values on the system.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4>Importance of Monitoring IOCs:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Helps in early detection of a breach or attack.</li>
                    <li>Provides evidence for investigating and mitigating security incidents.</li>
                    <li>Improves the overall security posture by identifying weaknesses in the network.</li>
                  </ul>

                 <div style="background-color:rgb(222, 222, 222); border: 2px; color: rgb(132, 1, 1); font-size: 20px;">J</div>

                 <div class="q">JWT (JSON Web Token)</div>
<div class="a">
  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Example</h5>
  <p>Imagine a user logs in to a web application, and the server issues a JWT to the client after successful authentication. This token contains the user's ID and roles. In future requests, the client sends this token in the `Authorization` header to authenticate and authorize actions.</p>
  <pre>
    Authorization: Bearer <JWT_Token_Here>
  </pre>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Definition</h5>
  <p>JSON Web Token (JWT) is a URL-safe token format for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications.</p>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Mitigation</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Tokens should have an expiration date to limit their lifespan.</li>
    <li>Avoid sending tokens in URL parameters to prevent interception (use headers instead).</li>
    <li>Enable the issuing server to revoke tokens (e.g., during logout) to prevent unauthorized use.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">JWT Structure</h5>
  <pre>
    Header.Payload.Signature
  </pre>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Header</h5>
  <p>The header contains metadata such as the algorithm used for signing the token (e.g., HMAC, RSA). The header is base64-url encoded.</p>
  <pre>
    {"alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT"}
  </pre>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Payload</h5>
  <p>The payload contains the user data and metadata, such as the user’s ID, name, or roles.</p>
  <pre>
    {"sub": "1234567890", "name": "John Doe", "email": "___", "iat": 1516239022}
  </pre>
  <p><strong>iat</strong>: *Issued At* — timestamp when the JWT was issued.</p>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Signature</h5>
  <p>The signature is used to verify the integrity and authenticity of the token. It is created by signing the base64-encoded header and payload with a secret key or private key (e.g., HMAC SHA-256).</p>
  <pre>
    Signature = HMACSHA256(base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload), secretKey)
  </pre>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Attacks</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>JWT Signature Modification</strong>: If the "alg" is set to "none", the signature can be removed, allowing an attacker to forge a token and impersonate a user with elevated privileges.</li>
    <li><strong>Accepting Tokens with No Signature</strong>: Some servers might accept tokens with an invalid signature or none at all, which allows attackers to modify or create their own tokens.</li>
    <li><strong>Brute Forcing</strong>: Weak or misconfigured JWT secrets can be exploited using brute force tools like hashcat to guess the secret key.</li>
    <li><strong>JWT Header Parameter Injection</strong>: Attackers can inject malicious parameters (e.g., `kid`, `jku`) into the JWT header, leading to vulnerabilities like path traversal or remote code execution.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">JWT vs JWS vs JWE</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>JWS (JSON Web Signature)</strong>: A JWT with a digital signature that ensures the integrity and authenticity of the data.</li>
    <li><strong>JWE (JSON Web Encryption)</strong>: A JWT that is encrypted to ensure confidentiality, protecting the data from unauthorized access.</li>
  </ul>

                    <ol>
                      <li>The client calls the LLM with the user's prompt.</li>
                      <li>The LLM detects that a function needs to be called and returns a JSON object containing arguments adhering to the external API's schema.</li>
                      <li>The client calls the function with the provided arguments.</li>
                      <li>The client processes the function's response.</li>
                      <li>The client calls the LLM again, appending the function response as a new message.</li>
                      <li>The LLM calls the external API with the function response.</li>
                      <li>The LLM summarizes the results of this API call back to the user.</li>

                  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Definition</h5>
                  <p>Attacker intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.</p>
                  
                  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">How/Where to Detect</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Check for unusual behavior in network traffic such as unexpected changes in IP addresses.</li>
                    <li>Monitor for **SSL/TLS** errors or expired certificates that may indicate tampering.</li>
                    <li>Analyze network traffic for unexpected delays or discrepancies in encryption.</li>
                    <li>Inspect HTTPS connections for **mixed content** issues or warning signs that the certificate chain has been compromised.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Mitigation</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Use **SSL/TLS encryption** for all sensitive data transmission to ensure data is protected from interception.</li>
                    <li>Implement **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)** to ensure that encryption keys are not reused across sessions.</li>
                    <li>Employ **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)** to enforce the use of HTTPS and prevent downgrade attacks.</li>
                    <li>Use **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** to ensure that even if credentials are intercepted, access is not easily gained.</li>
                    <li>Regularly check and update SSL certificates, ensuring they are from trusted certificate authorities.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Types</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>SSL Stripping:</strong> The attacker downgrades a secure HTTPS connection to an unencrypted HTTP connection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Session Hijacking:</strong> The attacker steals an active session token, allowing them to impersonate a legitimate user.</li>
                    <li><strong>DNS Spoofing:</strong> The attacker redirects the victim’s network traffic to a malicious server by manipulating DNS responses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Packet Injection:</strong> The attacker injects malicious packets into the communication stream, potentially altering the data being transmitted.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Example</h5>
                  <p>An example of a MITM attack is when an attacker sets up a fake Wi-Fi hotspot (e.g., "Free Public Wi-Fi") in a public place and intercepts the network traffic of users who connect to it, potentially capturing sensitive data like login credentials or credit card details.</p>

                  <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">HTTP Security Header</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):</strong> A security header that forces browsers to only communicate with the server using HTTPS, mitigating certain types of MITM attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Content-Security-Policy (CSP):</strong> Helps prevent malicious content from being injected into web pages, which could be used in a MITM attack to deliver malicious payloads.</li>
                    <li><strong>X-Content-Type-Options:</strong> Ensures that browsers strictly interpret content as its declared type, preventing attackers from injecting malicious content in unexpected formats.</li>

                    <p>A <strong>null session</strong> refers to an unauthenticated connection to a computer or server that allows a user to connect to the system without providing a username or password. It is typically used to gather information about a system, especially in older versions of <strong>Windows</strong>.</p>

                    <h4>Key Features:</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>No Authentication:</strong> No need for a username or password.</li>
                      <li><strong>Limited Access:</strong> Typically provides limited access to certain services, like file shares, but does not grant full access to the system.</li>
                      <li><strong>Information Gathering:</strong> Attackers can gather valuable system information, such as machine name, shares, or users.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>How It Works:</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>A system might accept a null session connection to <strong>NetBIOS</strong> (port 139 or 445) or <strong>SMB</strong> (Server Message Block) protocol.</li>
                      <li>Attackers may use null sessions to gather system information (e.g., user names, machine names, etc.).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Risks:</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Potential for <strong>enumeration attacks</strong> to discover system configurations, user accounts, or network shares.</li>
                      <li>Can be used in <strong>internal network attacks</strong> or <strong>remote reconnaissance</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>

                      <p><strong>Pharming</strong> is a type of cyber attack where a user is directed to a fraudulent website that appears to be legitimate, typically by manipulating the DNS (Domain Name System) or altering host files.</p>

                      <h4>How It Works:</h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The attacker compromises a DNS server or the user's local machine.</li>
                        <li>The victim tries to visit a legitimate site (e.g., their bank’s website).</li>
                        <li>Instead of the real site, they are redirected to a fake site that looks identical.</li>
                        <li>The attacker captures sensitive data entered by the victim.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <h4>Key Characteristics:</h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Invisible to users — the redirection happens without their knowledge.</li>
                        <li>Highly effective — users trust the fraudulent site because it looks legitimate.</li>

                    <li><strong>External</strong>: Focus on external assets (e.g., website, DNS).</li>
                    <li><strong>Internal</strong>: Focus on internal systems (e.g., network, servers).</li>
                    <li><strong>Web App</strong>: Tests web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Engineering</strong>: Tests human factors (e.g., phishing, pretexting).</li>
                    <li><strong>Wireless</strong>: Tests wireless security (e.g., weak Wi-Fi encryption).</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical</strong>: Tests physical security (e.g., bypassing locks, cameras).</li>

                    <div class="a"> 
                      <p><strong>System hardening</strong> is the process of securing a system by reducing its surface of vulnerability. This is achieved by configuring the system securely, removing unnecessary services, and applying security patches to minimize the risk of attacks.</p>
                      <h4>Key Steps in System Hardening:</h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Patch Management:</strong> Regularly update the system with the latest security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Disabling Unnecessary Services:</strong> Turn off services or features that are not needed to reduce potential attack vectors.</li>
                        <li><strong>File Permissions:</strong> Set strict file permissions to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive files and directories.</li>
                        <li><strong>Secure Configurations:</strong> Configure software and hardware securely, including firewall rules, authentication mechanisms, and logging settings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Least Privilege Principle:</strong> Assign the least amount of access or privileges necessary for users and processes to perform their tasks.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <h4>Benefits of System Hardening:</h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Reduces the attack surface of a system.</li>
                        <li>Improves system security by minimizing vulnerabilities.</li>

                    <div class="a">
                      <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Definition</h5>
                      <p><strong>SAML</strong> is a widely used standard for Single Sign-On (SSO) that allows users to authenticate once and access multiple services. However, like any protocol, it has vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers if not properly secured.</p>
                    
                      <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">How/Where to Detect</h5>
                      <p>SAML-based authentication is typically detected through logs, network traffic analysis, and web application security monitoring. Look for SAML tokens or assertions being transmitted in HTTP headers.</p>
                    
                      <h3>SAML Vulnerabilities</h3>
                    
                      <h4>Common SAML Vulnerabilities:</h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>SAML Assertion Manipulation:</strong> Attackers can manipulate the SAML assertion (authentication data) to gain unauthorized access by altering or injecting fake assertion data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assertion Replay:</strong> Attackers can intercept and replay valid SAML assertions to impersonate users and gain unauthorized access.</li>
                        <li><strong>Weak or Missing Signature Validation:</strong> If the SAML assertion is not properly signed or validated, attackers can forge or modify assertions, potentially allowing them to impersonate legitimate users.</li>
                        <li><strong>XML Signature Wrapping (XSW):</strong> Attackers can tamper with the XML structure of the SAML message, bypassing signature verification and altering the data in the request.</li>
                        <li><strong>Open Redirects:</strong> A vulnerability where a malicious attacker tricks the service provider into redirecting a user to a malicious URL during the SAML process, potentially leading to phishing attacks.</li>
                        <li><strong>SAML Token Hijacking:</strong> If a SAML token is intercepted or leaked, attackers can reuse it to impersonate users and gain unauthorized access to services.</li>
                        <li><strong>Misconfigured Identity Providers (IdP):</strong> Incorrect configurations or weak security practices on the IdP side (e.g., default or weak passwords, lack of MFA) can lead to attackers gaining access to sensitive resources.</li>
                      </ul>
                    
                      <h4>Mitigating SAML Vulnerabilities:</h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Enforce Strong Signature Validation:</strong> Always validate SAML assertions and responses with the appropriate signatures to ensure their integrity and authenticity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use Encrypted Assertions:</strong> Encrypt SAML assertions to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access during transmission.</li>
                        <li><strong>Implement MFA:</strong> Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for additional protection during SAML-based logins to reduce the risk of token hijacking or exploitation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limit Assertion Lifespan:</strong> Set a short expiration time for SAML tokens to minimize the risk of token replay attacks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> Regularly audit and review your SAML implementation to ensure it adheres to security best practices and is resistant to common vulnerabilities.</li>
                      </ul>
                    
                      <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Types</h5>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Single Sign-On (SSO):</strong> Allows users to authenticate once and access multiple systems without re-authenticating.</li>
                        <li><strong>Federated Identity Management:</strong> Enables identity sharing across different domains or organizations.</li>
                      </ul>
                    
                      <h5 style="background-color: #eccdcf;">Example</h5>
                      <p>A typical example is when an employee logs in to a corporate network (using SAML) and is automatically granted access to other enterprise applications like email, HR systems, and cloud services without having to log in again.</p>

                    <h3>TCP/IP Internet Layer</h3>
                    <p>The TCP/IP Internet Layer is responsible for addressing, routing, and forwarding packets between devices across networks. It ensures that data can travel from the source to the destination, even if they are on different networks. This layer focuses on the logical addressing and routing, as well as error handling and diagnostics.</p>
                    <h4>Key Functions:</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Routing:</strong> Determines the path that data packets take from source to destination across different networks.</li>
                      <li><strong>Addressing:</strong> Uses logical IP addresses to uniquely identify devices on a network.</li>
                      <li><strong>Packet Forwarding:</strong> Forwards data packets across network boundaries, ensuring they reach their correct destination.</li>
                      <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Provides error reporting through protocols like ICMP.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>IP (Internet Protocol):</strong> Routes packets based on IP addresses.</li>
                      <li><strong>ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):</strong> Handles error messages and diagnostics.</li>
                      <li><strong>ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):</strong> Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses within local networks.</li>
                      <li><strong>RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol):</strong> Resolves MAC addresses to IP addresses (used less frequently today).</li>

                <p>A <strong>VPN (Virtual Private Network)</strong> is a service that creates a secure, encrypted connection over the internet between the user and a remote server. It helps protect data from hackers, provides privacy, and can bypass geographical restrictions.</p>

                <h4>Types of VPNs:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Remote Access VPN</strong>: Connects individual users to a private network remotely (e.g., employees accessing a company network).
                    <br><strong>Example:</strong> Cisco AnyConnect, OpenVPN.</li>
                  
                  <li><strong>Site-to-Site VPN</strong>: Connects entire networks to each other (e.g., linking two branch offices).
                    <br><strong>Example:</strong> MPLS VPN, IPsec VPN.</li>
                  
                  <li><strong>SSL VPN (Secure Sockets Layer VPN)</strong>: Uses SSL/TLS protocols for secure remote access via a web browser.
                    <br><strong>Example:</strong> OpenVPN (with SSL/TLS encryption).</li>
                  
                  <li><strong>IPsec VPN (Internet Protocol Security VPN)</strong>: Provides encrypted communication at the IP layer for secure communication between two endpoints.
                    <br><strong>Example:</strong> IPSec-based VPNs for site-to-site connections.</li>
                  
                  <li><strong>L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) VPN</strong>: Combines L2TP and IPsec for encryption, providing secure tunneling.
                    <br><strong>Example:</strong> L2TP/IPsec for remote access.</li>
                  
                  <li><strong>PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)</strong>: One of the oldest VPN protocols, often considered less secure.
                    <br><strong>Example:</strong> PPTP connections in legacy systems.</li>

                  <h2>1. Web Cache Deception</h2>
                  <p>
                    Web Cache Deception involves finding a dynamic page that can be accessed via a URL format that the web cache 
                    mistakenly treats as cacheable. 
                    <br>
                    Example: Accessing <code>/transactions</code> via <code>/transactions.jpg</code>.
                  </p>

                    <strong>Attack Flow:</strong>
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>An attacker tricks a victim into visiting a crafted, cacheable URL.</li>
                    <li>The victim’s private information is stored in the cache under that URL.</li>
                    <li>The attacker loads the same URL and retrieves the victim’s data from the cache.</li>
                  </ul>
                
                  <h2>2. Web Cache Poisoning</h2>
                  <p>
                    Web Cache Poisoning involves finding an input that changes the response in an exploitable way, 
                    without affecting the cache key used by the server.
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>An attacker sends a request with a malicious payload.</li>
                    <li>The server responds with a modified response, but the cache stores this response under a "normal" cache key.</li>
                    <li>Other users receive the poisoned (malicious) response when accessing the same page.</li>
